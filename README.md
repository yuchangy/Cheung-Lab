Summary:

APOE is cholestrol carrying protein that has been known to cause Alzheimer's Disease later on in a person's life. This is due to an overexpression of the gene that carries an additional amounts of cholestrol to the brain. This project's goal is to analyze data from the Rush University's Alzheimer's Disease Center and see if there is a pattern with the expression level of APOE in different types of Alzheimer patients. All patient data were donated by the patient post mortem and made public by the University for Research Purpooses.


Conclusion: Images of the Boxplot Result indicates that there is a reduced expression of APOE in Alzheimer's Disease Patients. A hypothesis I can draw from this conclusion is that the brain has trouble processing fat in the brain, which could cause certain neurons to be blocked. 

Future Goal:
Aside from APOE, I would like to see if there are other over expressions of genes that also have a cause on the development of Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, I want to look to see if younger patients with Alzheimer's disease also have this issue of low APOE gene expression
