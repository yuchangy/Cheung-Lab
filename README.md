Summary:

APOE is cholestrol carrying protein that has been known to cause Alzheimer's Disease later on in a person's life. This is due to an overexpression of the gene that carries an additional amounts of cholestrol to the brain. This project's goal is to analyze data from the Rush University's Alzheimer's Disease Center and see if there is a pattern with the expression level of APOE in different types of Alzheimer patients. All patient data were donated by the patient post mortem and made public by the University for Research Purpooses
